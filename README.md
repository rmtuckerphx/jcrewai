# JCrewAI

JCrewAI is a multi-agent automation framework and is a TypeScript implementation based mostly on the [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) Python framework.

The project is in the early stages and supports Crews but not Flows. OpenAI is the only LLM implementation provided. Tools support needs to be added.
